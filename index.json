Iris is someone’s grandmother, mother, sister and wife. But she’s slipping away. At the age of 91, she suffers from dementia and couldn’t recall most of the stuff. Tess and her grandmother Iris have a very strong relationship with each other and she wants to hold onto her as long as she can. When Iris’ health starts deteriorating, it comes upon Tess to look after her and arrange for homecare. However, Tess’ unplanned pregnancy is also something which she is finding hard to accept. Among all the chaos, she turns towards her mother, Donna for support who has been away almost for all her life. As their lives are intertwining, the friendship which blossoms between them helps both of them to move forward. As Tess struggles to deal with life alone, she meets another beautiful yet lonely soul, Gigi who resonates with her. As their stories are woven together, their support keeps the hope alive for a better future. While Gigi is struggling to get out of someone she doesn’t want to be anymore, Tess is trying to find herself. With a secret suitcase of letters which are a chain of conversation between Iris and someone called Tom, Tess tries to find out the missing pieces of her grandma’s life she never knew. Maybe this could give Tess the answer or the will to accept changes in her life. This book is all about people supporting each other, taking chances and finding happiness when you least expect it. Elizabeth Noble beautifully crafted this story where we see different relationships being born and certain encounters being life changing moments. In moments of darkness, the author always turns it to put a pinch of hope in the story. A wholesome book which will put tears and a smile on one’s face in the end.
